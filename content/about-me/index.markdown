## I’m Jimmy Smutek



![Headshot for Jimmy Smutek](/img/2015/02/headshot-web.jpeg)


I’m a web developer from Baltimore Maryland. I work at Johns Hopkins, [Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://jhsph.edu) as Sr. Programmer Analyst on the Communications & Marketing team, in the Department of External Affairs. Before that I worked at [Ainsley Agency](https://ainsleyagency.com), first as a Web Developer and eventually as Lead Web Developer.

Prior to joining the Ainsley team I worked as a freelance web developer for 2 years, helping small businesses create engaging and effective websites.

My background was originally in graphic design, and I worked as a designer for about ten years.

I studied Computer Graphics & Visual Communication at CCBC and Corporate Communication at the University of Baltimore. I like modular synthesizers, drum machines and skateboards, and I love hanging out with my family, and learning new stuff.

I think equity is important. Everyone deserves a fair shot.

This is my web development blog. I also <del>maintain</del> neglect my personal blog at [smutek.blog](https://smutek.blog) if you'd like to check it out.
