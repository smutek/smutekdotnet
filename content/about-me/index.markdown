## I’m Jimmy Smutek



![Headshot for Jimmy Smutek](/img/img_1683-1.jpg)


I’m a computer programmer, information technology professional, musician, and general tech nerd from Baltimore, Maryland. I have Autism, I’m a recovering heroin addict with over 20 years clean, and I struggle with a variety of mental illnesses such as anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorders. I am generally obsessed with computers, computer programming, infosec, digital art, and electronic music production.

I’m currently off work and convalescing after a major mental health event in mid-2020. I’ve worked in the Office of External Affairs at Johns Hopkins University, Bloomberg School of Public Health as a Senior Programmer Analyst and Lead Web Developer, both on the Comms & Marketing team and at Baltimore agency Ainsley & Co. as Lead Web Developer.

I’ve studied Computer Graphics and Visual Communication at Community College of Baltimore County, Marketing and Corporate Communication at the University of Baltimore, and Software Development and Security at the University of Maryland.

My professional background began in graphics design, and I was able to gain a broad creative and technical foundation while working as a work-study, part-time for the Baltimore nonprofit, Baltimore Art & Music Project. I worked closely with the Director to create print branding and web collateral for local grassroots arts & music events. My love of learning and technology eventually led me into full-time web development, and then to focus on backend systems, software development, and security.

I like to make electronic music with my drum machines and synths, and I’m a tech and computer nerd in general so I enjoy learning about programming, information security, and operating systems as a hobby. I’m a Mac user but I also nerd out a lot on various flavors of Linux. Python is my favorite language but I can also program with PHP, Java, Bash, JavaScript, and Adobe Cold Fusion.

I openly identify as anti-fascist and anti-racist because fascism and racism are bad and Black Lives Matter. I support diversity, inclusion, equity, and empowerment with a special shout-out for neurodiversity.

This is my web development blog. I also have my personal blog at [smutek.blog](https://smutek.blog) if you'd like to check it out.
