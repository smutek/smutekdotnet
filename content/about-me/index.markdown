## I’m Jimmy Smutek



![Headshot for Jimmy Smutek](https://smutek.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/headshot-web-300x300.jpeg)


I’m a web developer from Baltimore Maryland. I work at Johns Hopkins, [Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://jhsph.edu) as Sr. Programmer Analyst on the Communications & Marketing team, in the Department of External Affairs. Before that I worked at [Ainsley Agency](https://ainsleyagency.com), first as a Web Developer and eventually as Lead Web Developer.

Prior to joining the Ainsley team I worked as a freelance web developer for 2 years, helping small businesses create engaging and effective websites.

My background was originally in graphic design, and I worked as a designer for about ten years.

I studied Computer Graphics & Visual Communication at CCBC and Corporate Communication at the University of Baltimore. I like modular synthesizers, drum machines and skateboards, and I love hanging out with my family, and learning new stuff.

    * Self taught web application developing programming analyst from Baltimore, Maryland. I'm honest, fiercely loyal, autistic (late life diagnosis @47), and an addiction survivor (dope & coke, IV, clean 20+ yrs). Severe anxiety and depression, it sucks & I own it so it can't be used against me. Been to prison for stealing meat from a supermarket. Sat alone in a cell with a serial killer. Alumni, Baltimore City Jail, D Block, Annex, ECI. Started over in '99. Stymied by your ever-changing social contracts. Ally. Decent human, interesting too. Once stumped an actuary with simple common sense.



I think equity is important. Everyone deserves a fair shot.

This is my web development blog. I also <del>maintain</del> neglect my personal blog at [smutek.blog](https://smutek.blog) if you'd like to check it out.
