As of Sage 8.2 the Bootstrap navigation has been removed. This is part of Sage's move towards framework agnosticism. There's good discussion here, [on the GitHub pull request](https://github.com/roots/sage/pull/1427).

As of now, adding the navigation back is super easy, and Ben Word links to everything you'll need to do this at the bottom of the same discussion, [here](https://github.com/roots/sage/pull/1427#issuecomment-97305637).

Adding the nav back is so easy that it doesn't really warrant a video, but I like making videos, so here's a quick walk through. :)

I had a small glitch at the 2:30 mark as I didn't add the path correctly in the includes, so sorry about that, but I recover quickly. Hopefully someone will find this video helpful.

Thanks a ton to the Roots team for the amazing work.
