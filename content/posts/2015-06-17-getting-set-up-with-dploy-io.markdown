Code deployments with dploy.io are truly a wonderful thing, here's a quick video walk-through showing how to get dploy up and running on a project.

For this demo I'm working with a WordPress theme, but the same concepts should apply to pretty much any project. I cover both automatic and manual deployments.

Hopefully you'll find this video somewhat helpful.

If you're still living under the tyranny of FTP, do yourself a favor and check out dploy.io or a similar service.
