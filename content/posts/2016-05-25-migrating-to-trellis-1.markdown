### Pt. 1 - Setting up Trellis & Bedrock locally


This is the first in a series of screencasts that will document the process of moving a WordPress website (this website) from a shared hosting provider to a Digital Ocean droplet with Trellis, Bedrock, and Sage, with an SSL from Let's Encrypt.

In this screencast I'll get my local development environment setup with Trellis & Bedrock.

[In part 2](https://smutek.net/migrating-to-trellis-2/) I get my theme and plugins installed, and migrate my data into my development environment.

[In part 3](https://smutek.net/shared-hosting-to-roots-stack-part-3/)  I setup my Digital Ocean droplet, prepare my project, provision the server and deploy the site.
