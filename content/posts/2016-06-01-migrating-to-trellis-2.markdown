### Pt. 2 - Install plugins via Composer, migrate data

{{<vimeo 168877537>}}

This is the second in a series of screen-casts that will document the process of moving a WordPress website from a shared hosting provider to a Digital Ocean droplet with Trellis, Bedrock, and Sage, with an SSL from Let's Encrypt.

[In the first screen-cast](/migrating-to-trellis-1/) I setup Trellis & Bedrock.

In this screen-cast I'll get my theme & plugins installed, deal with a couple of premium plugins, and migrate my data into my development environment.

[In part 3](/shared-hosting-to-roots-stack-part-3/)  I setup my Digital Ocean droplet, prepare my project, provision the server and deploy the site.
