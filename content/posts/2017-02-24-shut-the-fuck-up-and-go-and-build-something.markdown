Check out this [interview with Ghost founder John O'Nolan](https://www.indiehackers.com/businesses/ghost). It was interesting to read about the history of the project, but I thought this was a fantastic takeaway -



<blockquote>
**What's your advice for indie hackers who are just starting out?**

Honestly my single piece of advice would probably be to stop looking for so much advice. Shut the fuck up and go and build something.

I see so many people devouring startup books and blog posts and talking about them incessantly. They try to just endlessly research and talk about what works, because they're too afraid to actually jump in and do something.

If you feel like you have no idea what you're doing, well, welcome to the club. None of us have any idea what the fuck we're doing, and anyone who says otherwise is lying. All of us are just guessing, experimenting, trying things. Not a single one of us was ever "sure" or "ready" or "confident" at any point. At a certain point you just have to jump.

Stop reading. Start building.

Stop reading, start building. No doubt! Well, I'll never stop reading, but I get the point. :)
