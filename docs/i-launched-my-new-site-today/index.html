            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I am super excited to announce that I launched my new site today! I thought it would be a good idea to make a post about my plans. Who I seek to serve, what I plan to do, why I am doing it, and where I&rsquo;ve found inspiration.</p>
<p><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dqrbt3vps/image/upload/v1448214859/LaunchAnnoucementFeaturedImage_zmu8fc.jpg" alt="Mockup image of the new smutek.net website"></p>
<h2 id="who-i-want-to-serve">Who I want to serve.</h2>
<p>The audience I seek to serve is small business owners who would like help with their web presence. I specialize in WordPress and I offer a variety of services related to that platform. I&rsquo;m especially interested in working with professionals in the wedding industry. Photographers, DJ&rsquo;s, caterers, event planners, officiates, etc.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-plan-to-do">What I plan to do.</h2>
<p>My goal is to provide value to, and build relationships with anyone who is running a business and who has a web presence. I&rsquo;ll be posting weekly blog posts, on Friday afternoons, with various WordPress and web design related tips and tricks. I plan to cover everything from basic day to day stuff, like this weeks post, to super geeky coding tutorials.</p>
<p>I have a large list of ideas for posts but if you have an idea for something you&rsquo;d like me to cover please hit my
<a href="https://smutek.net/contact/">contact form</a> and send a suggestion.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-am-doing-this">Why I am doing this.</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working as a professional designer since 2003. My background is in print design and I used to do lot of
posters, logos, brochures, small websites and just about everything else under the sun. I love technology and I&rsquo;ve
always been an avid self teacher, so eventually I moved from print design to web design. You can read more in my
<a href="https://smutek.net/about-me/">about</a> section, but the main point is that I was laid off from my job doing WordPress work back in
August of 2013 and I&rsquo;ve been self employed ever since.</p>
<h3 id="self-employment-is-different">Self employment is&hellip; different.</h3>
<p>The first year and a half was a big change of pace for me and a lot to wrap my head around. I&rsquo;ve always worked for someone else, working for myself has been a huge change. One thing that became apparent was that I needed to focus my efforts.</p>
<h3 id="my-old-site">My old site.</h3>
<p>My previous site was designed with one thing in mind; to land me a job as a web designer. I built the site in December of 2013 and by February of 2013 I had landed a job as a junior front end developer at a small agency in Towson. Mission accomplished! My previous site was great, but it didn&rsquo;t reflect my current goals. Once I worked out what my current goals actually are, I designed new branding and started work on this site.</p>
<h3 id="my-new-site">My new site.</h3>
<p>This site, and my new branding, represents my focus and commitment to web design and web development. It also represents my commitment to share the things that I know and the things that I am learning, with others. Please have a look around and let me know your thoughts. If you see anything that doesn&rsquo;t look quite right please be sure to let me know as well, either in the comments or <a href="https://smutek.net/contact/">via email</a>.</p>
<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>
<p>Inspiration comes in a lot of forms. I just want to give a shout out to some people in the creative community who have inspired me in a business sense.</p>
<h3 id="curtis-mchale">Curtis McHale</h3>
<p>First and foremost is Curtis McHale. Curtis&rsquo;s tagline is &ldquo;Helping you answer the hard questions about your business&rdquo;. His posts and the interaction I&rsquo;ve had with him have been a huge motivation for me to get my butt in gear and focus on my business.</p>
<p><a href="http://curtismchale.ca/">Check out his site.</a></p>
<h3 id="sean-mccabe-and-ben-toalson">Sean McCabe and Ben Toalson</h3>
<p>Sean and Ben are the hosts of the seanwes podcast. It&rsquo;s a podcast focused on helping people earn a living by pursuing their passion. Sounds cliche, but it&rsquo;s a must-listen. It&rsquo;s like, self-help meets business advice and I am inspired by every episode that I listen to.</p>
<p><a href="http://seanwes.com/podcast/">Check out the podcast.</a></p>
<h3 id="also">Also&hellip;</h3>
<p>I also want to mention:</p>
<p><a href="http://chrislema.com/">Chris Lema</a>, whose blog has been an inspiration to me since I started on my own.</p>
<p>Matt Medieros, whose <a href="https://mattreport.com/">Matt Report podcast</a> provides consistent, ongoing value.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/">Gary Vaynerchuk</a>, whose level of hustle is amazing.</p>
<p>All the people that I listed above do great work. They are all successful entrepreneurs, and they&rsquo;ve all provided value and inspiration to me.</p>
<p>I hope to do the same.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m super excited for this launch, and for what the future holds!</p>
