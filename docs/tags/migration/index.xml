      <description>This is the third in a series of screencasts that will document the process of moving a WordPress website from a shared hosting provider to a Digital Ocean droplet with Trellis, Bedrock, and Sage, with an SSL from Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt.
Correction: The video opens with: &amp;hellip;this is part four of a three part series&amp;hellip; Sorry, It was late. :)
I didn&amp;rsquo;t obscure any passwords in this video but, for obvious reasons, after recording I rebuilt my droplet, reset all passwords, and redeployed the project.</description>
